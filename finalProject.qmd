Check out my Final Project [here](https://jacksonphilion.github.io/final-project-portfolio/)!

My partner and I implemented a Fast Fourier Transform on our MCU which processed an audio signal. We captured the signal using the ADC and DMA after sending it through a custom analog amplifier. Then, we displayed the signal out to the user via an LCD driver built within our FPGA.

Check out the final product and block diagram below, for reference. It was a pretty sweet system!
