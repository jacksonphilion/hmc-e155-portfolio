Hello! My name is Jackson Philion. I'm a senior engineering student at Harvey Mudd College with a focus in Electrical Engineering and experience in Hardware and Systems Engineering. I attended Concord Academy high school in Concord, Massachusetts, before graduating in 2020 and spending a gap year pursuing web development at Egghead Ventures and R&D testing and prototyping at Cobra Puma Golf. I have since worked with Sol Clarity, a green energy start-up where I helped design the hardware for their upcoming field trial. After studying abroad at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand in their Electrical Engineering department, I look forward to starting a career in the semiconductor industry. I get excited about helping us pave the way towards a future with safer, more sustainable, and mind-bogglingly powerful silicon devices.
