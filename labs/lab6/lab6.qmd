## Lab 6: The Internet of Things and Serial Peripheral Interface

Due to changes in the course's arrangement and my personal goals, my individual work on Lab 6 was paused in favor of instead working towards the Final Project. Check out my report on the final project [here](https://jacksonphilion.github.io/final-project-portfolio/)! My partner and I implemented a Fast Fourier Transform on our MCU which processed an audio signal. We captured the signal using the ADC and DMA after sending it through a custom analog amplifier. Then, we displayed the signal out to the user via an LCD driver built within our FPGA.
