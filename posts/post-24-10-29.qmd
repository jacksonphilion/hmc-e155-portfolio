Consider this the start of a (hopefully) multi-part series on this blog channel. As I spend time hunting and interviewing for my first full time position out of school, I'm reminded of the importance of reflecting back on past experiences. Not only is this experiential recall important for answering basic interview questions, but it also helps support a more robust understanding of how design processes and ideas interconnect. With this Past Experiences series, I hope to reinforce this learning and recall by reflecting on a particular highlighted project, job, or time in my life.

This week, I want to consider my most recent job at Sol Clarity, a start-up company just outside of Boston in Somerville, Massachusetts.
